# hello-world
This is my first trial for creating new repository.
I worked on a long program provided by our ministry of communication and throughout this program, I faced real-life problems and worked with real-life data, I performed a different analysis to gain the best insights about this data.
Also, I gained experience in A/B testing and hypothesis testing.
I have a really good background in statistics and probability.
